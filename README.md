# LinkedIn Connections Analysis

This is the repository of the analysis of tmy LinkedIn Connections data. For a concise report, here's a link to the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@sarah-akinkunmi/linkedin-connections-analysis-1a40eb9c9d46) on the analysis.


## Purpose of the analysis
The objective of my analysis is to determine the
- total number of connections I have.
- connections made over time. In the Power BI report, you would see this first as years (2017â€“2022) and you can drill down to quarters in a particular year, months of a year, or even days in the month.
- professions and their connection count.
- companies and their connection count.

## Process
- Data collection - data request
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis and visualization
